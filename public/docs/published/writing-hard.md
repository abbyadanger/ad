It's been a few weeks since I've gotten more consistent with the blog and I'm so enjoying sharing my thoughts on this tiny corner of the internet.

Surprising to me, the hardest part of the blog has been ... writing 🙃

I thought that after I had all of the coding done for the website, I could relax and the things I want to write about would just come to me very easily and quickly.

That has not been the case. Sure, there are a lot of things I want to write about and share. However, I'm still getting used to approaching writing in general, but also in a way that I know people (you) are going to be reading it. I like for things to be formatted, well said, easily readable, a complete thought, etc.

Maybe the solution is to actually care ... less 🥱

Writing requires more focus and consistency than I thought - I'm learning that is unnatural to me, but I suppose that's why I'm doing it.

Life feels like [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/52vA3CYKZqZVdQnzRrdZt6?si=9ec728aecea54d2e) lately.

That's all,
