HNY!

Every start of a new year feels more and more sentimental than the last. I've always liked to make & reflect on resolutions. Here are a few, but not all - I kept the #soft ones to myself.

Things I can cross off a list. Yes or No. I either did them or I didn't.  

\* PR half marathon  
\* Buy a bike  
\* Learn to top-rope climb  
\* Get a new job  
\* Learn how to play chess  
\* Call a family member once a week

Abstract. Can be applied in more ways than one. Ways to live. Might not make complete sense.

\* Be a more conscious consumer & reduce carbon footprint  
\* Digital Minimalism  
\* (Regular?) Minimalism  
\* Get the f\*ck off my phone  
\* Travel.  
\* Be constantly curious & educate myself about ... everything ?   
\* Talk to strangers & meet new people & just be a human  
\* Spend **quality** time with family & close friends - Be SO intentional about making memories  
\* Don't settle
