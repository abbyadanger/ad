Why ?

I built this website to provide a creative outlet for myself. I've been a developer for almost 5 years now and sometimes I feel like I have nothing to *actually* show for it. Which I've found is a [common feeling](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/191c51k/experienced_engineers_do_you_have_a_portfolio/) among other SEs in the industry. I decided to challenge myself and create this website that showcases my technical skills, as well as a space to share things I want to write about, hence the blog.

What ?

I don't really know what exactly I'm going to be writing about on here, but I do like the idea of writing briefly & often - Creating a sort of diary that captures my feelings, opinions, and thoughts. Just whatever else I might be experiencing at that moment in time. I don't want to think about it too much.

I strive to get better at writing and articulating my thoughts in general, so I'm hoping this will help with that too.

Writing is important, I don't think it matters so much what you're writing about, just that you are. #deep

I guess I don't have anything else to say other than I'm proud of myself for finally building this (I've been wanting to for a long time) and that I'm excited to start writing more.

Thanks if you read this, maybe you'll read more. It's OK if you don't though.

Bye.
