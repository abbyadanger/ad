[Lagom](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/lagom) is a Swedish word meaning "not too much, not too little"

Across Sweden, this word represents a concept that embraces balance, moderation, and contentment. And I love that.

I read *[Lagom](https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-kitchen/all-about-swedish-fika/)* by Linnea Dunne a few weeks ago and haven't stopped thinking about it. The lifestyle and culture in Sweden could not be more opposite of that in America. Swedes have welcomed (& successfully integrated!) sustainability, work-life balance, and minimalism for several decades now. Not to mention Sweden ranks #4 in the [World Happiness Report](https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/2025/03/20/the-top-25-happiest-countries-in-2025-plus-our-four-favourite-findings-from-the-2025-world-happiness-report/?utm_term=&utm_campaign=&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=4743918760&hsa_cam=22942225324&hsa_grp=&hsa_ad=&hsa_src=x&hsa_tgt=&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23000155906&gbraid=0AAAAAooB9aNiyodSw_sCEIV3qaUvfYzxM&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyP3KBhD9ARIsAAJLnna2VGwGdQVquM9mw_o6rNYDI1_htOXkdyJZnVGr0ZGpfE9gmfFmULsaAjGAEALw_wcB) - Succeeding it's neighboring countries of Finland, Denmark, and Iceland that are ranked #1 - #3, respectively.

America could learn a thing two.
