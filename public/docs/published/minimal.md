I've realized I'm a picky web designer. I change my mind a lot. I'm constantly making small changes to the website because my taste changes on a dime.

My theme and vision for the blog has always been ...... 🤍**minimal**🤍

I hate bad design and even more than that, I hate complicated code. To me ... less will **always** be more.

It took me way too long to realize that most people will be reading the blog in a mobile browser, on their phone. I neglected to even think about this since I'm always developing a **BIG** screen .... and then I'm also testing on a **BIG** screen. What about the *small* screen?

So now I test on *small* and **BIG** screen.

### Before

That's when I realized I hated the way this part of the blog looked. Too much text. Too scrunched together. So unnecessary. Too much useless information.

### After

I did some thinking. Got inspired. Thanks [William Jansson](https://williamjansson.com/info/).

Removed the tags. Removed the date. What's the most essential information? Probably the title. Readers can still see the tags and the date when you read the post. Problem solved.

I'll probably change it again soon ;)

Less is more.

Bye.
