Say hello to my beautiful girls - Sonnet & Prose ❤️

On Halloween, I became a (foster) mother to these two beautiful young women. Only 6 weeks old to be exact.

Since moving to my own apartment, I had debated adopting a cat but was torn since I'm gone so much. Fostering seemed like the perfect solution for a lot of reasons. It can free up shelter space, help provide specialized medical care, and can aid in controlling the local cat population. I also found it to be a good fit because of the short-term placement options!

## First Day
New to the world and to each other - This was also the girls' first day without their mom. I was so nervous about taking them home!

## ~3 Weeks Later
Soooo well acquainted with one another. Very wise and old (all of us) 👵

## On Fostering
Overall, I had a great foster experience! It made me realize that I miss taking care of something (or 2 *things* in this case 😺😺) other than myself. There is never a dull moment in the house with 2 kittens. It was so fulfilling to care for them and the companionship they provided me was more needed than I thought.

I highly *highly* recommend fostering a pet if you are willing & able or if you're just seeking an experience that could make you feel something. As of last week, there are **100+ kittens** at the local shelter currently seeking foster homes in Chicago ............ js.

[PAWS Chicago](https://www.pawschicago.org/how-to-help/foster) provided such a positive experience and the opportunity to support a no kill shelter was a no-brainer. From the research I did, I realized SO many shelters do **not** support [No Kill](https://www.pawschicago.org/no-kill-mission) - Luckily the well-establishment, size and scale of the PAWS organization makes it much easier for their shelters to support this.

They go back to the shelter this week and I know they will get adopted so fast. In fact, they are even helping me write this right now .... ✍️☕

Girls if you are reading this, I miss you and I found one of your toy mice under my bed this morning.

Meow.
