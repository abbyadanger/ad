Over the summer I sold my DSLR camera that I've had for the past 8 years and bought a point & shoot film camera. I hadn't felt the desire to take photos in quite some time and I wanted to change that.


I decided on the [Nikon One Touch 35mm](https://imaging.nikon.com/imaging/information/products_history/1980/#:~:text=Nikon%20L35AF2/L35AD2%20(One%2DTouch)) - Made in Japan & released in 1985 :)

Shooting on a point & shoot film camera makes you *reallllllly* think about the photo you are taking. It forces you to work with what you have - You can't be wasteful or make adjustments based the previous. It's a beautiful surprise getting your film back to see that the shot you weren't sure about is actually the best one in the entire roll. There is something really cool about that.

This camera has gotten me excited about taking photos again. I made a dedicated place for them to live at [abbydanger.com/film](https://abbydanger.com/film) - I'll be posting more of my pictures there in the future.

Here are some favorites from my first few rolls :)
