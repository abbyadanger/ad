Here's my writing flow

Idea (hardest part)

Morning
Try to set a side a little bit of time to write in the morning, after doing all my other morning chores and before I have to log onto work

Trying to get better at completing my entries in 1 go, I tend to create a draft/outline and then revisit it later on and complete it. Feels inefficient.

Editor
Write everything in Obsidian which I love. Great UI. Easy to use. I set my home directory/collection to save directly to my local code repo.


Repo Updates
The only thing I have to do in the repo is update the blog-posts.json file to include the metadata for my new post. Trying to figure out how to automate this part still .... But also it's not that big of a pain point.

Sometimes trying to optimize something very very small is just more work in itself. Not sure ROI would be worth it for something like this, especially with how young the code base is, I could wake up and decide to change it all one day.

So after updating, I see all my changes here: the metadata updates and the markdown file that I created/wrote in Obsidian (automatically shows up here which is nice)

Then I commit everything, my pipeline runs, and in usually <5 minutes, my changes will be *live*

Like I said before, probably room for improvement here and I'm not really sure how other people/blogs are doing it, but this is how I'm doing it :)
