The biggest challenge so far with the blog has surprisingly been .... writing.

I thought that after I had all of the coding done, I could sort of relax (?) I'd enjoy the fruit of my labors and just write.

I'm still getting used to approaching writing in general, but also in a way that I know people are going to read it. It needs to be formatted, well said, a complete thought, etc. 

I don't feel good enough. Whatever I'm writing about is not well said enough or not important enough or not #deep enough .......... all my insecurities. 

Writing requires real focus and dedication and I'm learning that is a little unnatural to me, but I suppose that's why I'm doing it.
