I've always made resolutions prior to a new year.

Here's a few (not all) that I'm excited about

### Complete a V5

### Consume Less

### Keep Writing

Bring people together ?
I don't even really know what I mean by this, but over the past year, the theme of community (in all senses) has proven to be so important to me. I want to have more of it, I want to create it (?) Friends of friends and mutual friends and getting more involved at local places in chicago and working together and doing things that benefit everyone and showing comradery. 
"Bowling Alone" by Robert Putnam want to read


See my family, often

There's more, but alas. 

P.S. Subject to change before **12/31/2025** if my heart so desires ..... ❤️

Happy (almost) New Year 🥂

Bye!
