# Welcome to the blog :O

Hello! This is my blog ... and this is my first blog post ever.

## Why ?
I built this website to provide a creative outlet for myself, in a lot of ways. I've been a developer for almost 5 years and sometimes I feel like I have nothing to show for it (turns out this is a common feeling among other SEs I've talked to). So I decided to challenge myself and create a code base from the ground up that showcases my technical skills, as well as creating a space to share things I want to write about, hence the blog.

## What ?
I don't really know what exactly I'm going to be writing about on here, but that's sort of the fun part (?) I like the idea of writing briefly and often - Creating a diary that captures my feelings, opinions, thoughts, things I find interesting, music, tech stuff, hobbies, theories, and whatever else I might be experiencing at that moment in time. I don't want to think about it too much.

Writing in a journal has been useful to me in recent years and I plan to use this space in a similar way (maybe). I strive to get better at writing and articulating my thoughts in general, so I'm hoping this will help with that too.

Writing is important, I don't think it matters so much what you're writing about, just that you are. 

## Bye
I guess I don't have anything else to say other than I'm proud of myself for finally building this (I've been wanting to for a long time) and that I'm excited to start writing more.

Thanks if you read this, maybe you'll read more. It's OK if you don't though.

Bye.
