I've realized I'm a picky web designer. I change my mind a lot. I'm constantly making small changes to the website because my taste changes on a dime.

My theme and vision for the blog has always been ...... **minimal** .... I hate bad design and even more than that, I hate complicated code.

To me ... less will **always** be more.

It took me too long to realize that most people will be reading the blog in a mobile browser, on their phone. I neglected to even think about this
